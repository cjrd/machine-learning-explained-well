# Machine Learning Explained Well
I am a former machine learning researcher who took a break from academia for ~5 years to build a startup. Now I've returned to research, and I'm often hunting for really good explanations of machine learning ideas (it's rare that they come from the original research paper). When I find an exceptional explanation/tutorial/etc, I'll add it here.
